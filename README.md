# MOBLIMA
This is a movie listing and booking application that allows movie goers to book movie tickets and allows the cinema staff to manage the cineplex data. This is a school project I did for my CZ2002 Object Oriented Design and Programming module in NTU. My group mates are Chulpaibul Jiraporn, Shivani Kannan and Bose Rajeswari. The documentation is available at https://rtkleong10.github.io/MOBLIMA/.
